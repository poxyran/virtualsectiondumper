# UpdateVSD for VSD #

_UpdateVSD_ was created by **UlisesSoft**. It is a tool to update files from the **Virtual Section Dumper** project.

Selecting the _Options_ -  _Set_ _Options_ menu from VSD will show you the configuration window for _UpdateVSD_.

These are the following options:

### Update tab ###

You can select between three types of updates:

  * Update manually: selecting this option you'll need to update the VSD files from the _Help_ - _Check_ _for_ _update_ menu in VSD main window.
  * Update when starting program: if you select this option, _UpdateVSD_ will run every time you start VSD but you can set the maximum number of updates with the _Updates_ _by_ _day_ spin control.
  * Automatic update mode: using this option, _UpdateVSD_ will run every certain time and it will check for updates. You can set the maximum number of updates with the _Updates_ _by_ _day_ spin control.

If you select the _Update_ _manually_ or the _Update_ _when_ _starting_ _program_ option you can check the _Do_ _not_ _prompt_ _before_ _updating_ checkbox to not be prompted by _UpdateVSD_ before updating files.

### Proxy tab ###

If you are behind a proxy, using the options in this tab, you can configure the proxy settings to be able to update VSD.
